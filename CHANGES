openvas-libraries 3.0.0 (2009-12-18)

This is the 3.0.0 release of the openvas-libraries module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS). It introduces a significantly
improved and changed source code architecture and therefore introduces a
new API for the other OpenVAS components.

OpenVAS 3.0 introduces a new architecture where openvas-libraries now
includes openvas-libnasl as well as redundant code from openvas-client.
Also, openvas-server is renamed to openvas-scanner and includes any
platform-dependent elements of openvas-plugins. As a result of this, the
source code line count has been reduced even though new features have
been added. Also, for running the scanner now only 2 modules are
required (instead of 4 as for OpenVAS 2.0).

New features of OpenVAS include support for IPv6 and WMI-Clients.
Version 3.0 also supports the new OpenVAS Manager and OpenVAS
Administrator as optional extensions. This combination leverages the
vulnerability scanner to a comprehensive vulnerability management
solution.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to the 3.0.0 release:

Meyer, Matthew Mundell, Laban Mwangi, Srinivasa NL, Jan Wagner,

It fixes a small number of issues discovered after the release of
openvas-libraries 2.0.2 and introduces new functionality designed to enable
improvements in other OpenVAS modules.

Main changes since 2.0.2:

* Support for localized security messages (e.g. umlauts) has been re-enabled.
* New functions for GnuTLS-based communication were added.
* New functions for authentication were added.
* An improved caching framework has been added ("NVT Info objects").

openvas-libraries 2.0.2 (2009-03-06)

This is the second maintenance release of the openvas-libraries module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0 series.

It fixes a number of issues discovered after the release of openvas-libraries
2.0.1.

Main changes since 2.0.1:
* A bug which caused plugins to hang or freeze under certain circumstances due
  to a blocking pcap device has been fixed.
* A bug which caused openvas-libraries to send a truncated HTTP version
  identifier when constructing HTTP requests has been fixed.
* A bug which broke the linking process under certain circumstances has been
  fixed.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Tim Brown, Vlatko
Kosturjak, Michael Meyer, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Michael Wiegand and Felix Wolfsteller.


openvas-libraries 2.0.1 (2009-02-06)

This is the first maintenance release of the openvas-libraries module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0 series.

It fixes a number of issues discovered after the release of openvas-libraries
2.0.0 and introduces support for upcoming features. Thanks to the continuing
audit of the code, a number of obsolete, unused and/or unnecessary functions
were identified and removed. The amount and the quality of the source code
documentation has been improved as well.

Effect when installing this version: The cache of NVT descriptions (located in
plugin_folder/.desc/) will be rebuild at next start of openvasd.
The cache files used to have the suffix ".desc" instead of ".nasl", e.g.
"x.desc" corrsponds to "x.nasl".  Now, the suffix ".desc" is appended, e.g.
"x.nasl.desc" corresponds to "x.nasl".  This also prevents that e.g. "x.nasl"
and "x.nes" (or "x.oval") will overwrite each others' cache file.
Recommendation: Clean the entire cache directory before restarting openvasd. If
you don't do this, the .desc/ directory will contain all cache files twice.
Other than unnecessary disk space consumption this has no bad effect.


Main changes since 2.0.0:
* Renamed caching files to conflict-free scheme
* Prepared support for sub-directories in plugins_folder in accordance with
  Change Request #24 (http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-24.html)
* Support for improved management of SSH credentials has been added in
  accordance with Change Request #20 (http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-20.html)
* Established automated source code documentation. HTML-Version is available
  under http://www.openvas.org/src-doc/openvas-libraries/2.0.1/index.html

Bugfixes:
* A configuration issue which caused the build process to fail on Mac OS X has
  been fixed. (Solves: #761)
* Missing includes which caused the build process to fail on Darwin and NetBSD
  have been added. (Solves: #860, #862)

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Tim Brown,
Stjepan Gros, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Felix Wolfsteller and Michael Wiegand.

openvas-libraries 2.0-beta1 (2008-09-23)

This release is a first beta version of the upcoming 2.0 release of OpenVAS.
This is the first release of openvas-libraries to fully implement OID support
and marks the switch from the Nessus Transport Protocol (NTP) to the improved
and cleaned up OpenVAS Transport Protocol (OTP). In addition, this release
contains minor bug fixes and updates to distribution files.

OpenVAS 2.0 will introduce a full set of new modules for OpenVAS Server
(openvas-libraries, openvas-libnasl and openvas-server) and the a new
OpenVAS-Client. The only  module OpenVAS 1.0 and OpenVAS 2.0 will  share is
openvas-plugins. This means that the OpenVAS NVT Feed is compatible with both
generations of OpenVAS.

However, in case you plan to try out the new generation of OpenVAS, you should
install it separately from OpenVAS 1.0 installation. Instructions on how to do
this will be added to the OpenVAS homepage after all relevant modules are
released as 2.0-beta1. A separate announcement will officially start the beta
testing phase for OpenVAS 2.0.

Main changes in this release:
* Fix to incorrect library usage that prevented building RPM packages under
  certain circumstances.
* Updates of Debian packaging files.
* Switch from Nessus plugin IDs to OIDs.
* Switch from Nessus Transport Protocol 1.2 to OpenVAS Transport Protocol 1.0.

  overflows under certain circumstances.

This release contains improvements to plugin handling and to the packaging files
for various distributions as well as minor bug fixes and cleanups.
Apart from this, this release prepares OID support for OpenVAS.

It is recommended to update to this release, because future releases
of openvas-libnasl and openvas-libnasl will require openvas-libraries 1.0.2
as minimum version.

* Updates of the OpenSUSE, Fedora and Debian packaging files.
* Preparation for support for OpenVAS OIDs.

  separate include files.
* Configure checks for libresolv have been improved but still fail
  on some systems.

Main changes are:

  binary packages with SSL-support)
* SSL now mandatory.
* Removed libpcap-nessus entirely. Now the system one is to be used.
* Many cleanups of ancient remains (still many to come)
* Removed various W32-specific elements, because W32 isn't
  a taget system anyway.
* Lots of renaming to avoid conflicts with parallel
  Nessus installation
