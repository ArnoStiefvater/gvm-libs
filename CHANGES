openvas-libraries 2.0-beta2 (2008-11-14)

This release is the second beta version of the upcoming 2.0 release of OpenVAS.
It contains improved 64-bit compatibility, support for transferring NVT
signature information to the client and various improvements.

This release is intended to contain all features intended for the final OpenVAS
2.0 release. Users are encouraged to test this release and to report bugs to the
OpenVAS bug tracker located at http://bugs.openvas.org/ .

If you have used the 2.0-beta1 release, we recommend that you update all your
OpenVAS modules (openvas-libraries, openvas-libnasl, openvas-server and
openvas-client) to 2.0-beta2.

If you are currently using the stable 1.0.x branch and want to take part in the
beta phase for 2.0, we recommend that you install 2.0-beta2 separately from your
OpenVAS 1.0 installation. Instructions on how to do this are available from the
OpenVAS website.

Main changes since 2.0-beta1:
* 64-bit compatibility has been considerably improved.
* Debian packaging files have been updated.
* Support for transferring NVT signature information to the client has been added.
* Bugfixes.
* Various code cleanups.

Gros, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Michael Wiegand and Felix Wolfsteller.


openvas-libraries 2.0-beta1 (2008-09-23)

This release is a first beta version of the upcoming 2.0 release of OpenVAS.
This is the first release of openvas-libraries to fully implement OID support
and marks the switch from the Nessus Transport Protocol (NTP) to the improved
and cleaned up OpenVAS Transport Protocol (OTP). In addition, this release
contains minor bug fixes and updates to distribution files.

OpenVAS 2.0 will introduce a full set of new modules for OpenVAS Server
(openvas-libraries, openvas-libnasl and openvas-server) and the a new
OpenVAS-Client. The only  module OpenVAS 1.0 and OpenVAS 2.0 will  share is
openvas-plugins. This means that the OpenVAS NVT Feed is compatible with both
generations of OpenVAS.

However, in case you plan to try out the new generation of OpenVAS, you should
install it separately from OpenVAS 1.0 installation. Instructions on how to do
this will be added to the OpenVAS homepage after all relevant modules are
released as 2.0-beta1. A separate announcement will officially start the beta
testing phase for OpenVAS 2.0.

Main changes in this release:
* Fix to incorrect library usage that prevented building RPM packages under
  certain circumstances.
* Updates of Debian packaging files.
* Switch from Nessus plugin IDs to OIDs.
* Switch from Nessus Transport Protocol 1.2 to OpenVAS Transport Protocol 1.0.
* Fix to incorrect usage of string functions that could have lead to buffer
  overflows under certain circumstances.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Tim Brown, Vlatko
Kosturjak, Jan Wagner, Jan-Oliver Wagner and Michael Wiegand

openvas-libraries 1.0.2 (2008-06-30)

This release contains improvements to plugin handling and to the packaging files
for various distributions as well as minor bug fixes and cleanups.
Apart from this, this release prepares OID support for OpenVAS.

It is recommended to update to this release, because future releases
of openvas-libnasl and openvas-libnasl will require openvas-libraries 1.0.2
as minimum version.

* Updates of the OpenSUSE, Fedora and Debian packaging files.
* Preparation for support for OpenVAS OIDs.
* Increased internal storage space for plugin preferences to allow for plugins
  with a large number of options.
* Fixed a bug that resulted in incorrect memory allocation on certain 64bit
  installations.
* Removed support for unencrypted communication with the client.
* Fixed a configuration issue that broke the build process on certain 64bit
  installations.
* Various code cleanups.

The changes might cause compile failures
or other defects for various operating systems.
Reports on problems are appreciated.

  separate include files.
* Configure checks for libresolv have been improved but still fail
  on some systems.
* File includes.h is not installed anymore.
* Compile option "--enable-bpf-sharing" and corresponding
  functionalityx has been removed.
* Added several include files which will be installed under include/openvas/
  These have been extracted from libopenvas.h which, for convenience,
  still includes all of the single new include files.
* Removed various unused modules and functions.
* Various fixes to reduce flawfinder warnings.

openvas-libraries 0.9.0 (2007-07-27)

The first initial release of openvas-libraries

  binary packages with SSL-support)
* SSL now mandatory.
* Removed libpcap-nessus entirely. Now the system one is to be used.
* Many cleanups of ancient remains (still many to come)
* Removed various W32-specific elements, because W32 isn't
  a taget system anyway.

  Nessus installation
