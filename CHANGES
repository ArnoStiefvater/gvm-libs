Further cleanups release.

Changes since 0.9.0 (2007-09-13):

* Renamed libhosts_gatherer to libopenvas_hg to

  with nessus-libraries.

  the other OpenVAS modules).

openvas-libraries 0.9.0 (2007-07-27)

The first initial release of openvas-libraries
after the fork from Nessus 2.2.x.

Main changes are:

* Replace OpenSSL by GNU/TLS (therefore it is allowed now to distribute
  binary packages with SSL-support)
* SSL now mandatory.
* Removed libpcap-nessus entirely. Now the system one is to be used.
* Many cleanups of ancient remains (still many to come)
* Removed various W32-specific elements, because W32 isn't
  a taget system anyway.
* Lots of renaming to avoid conflicts with parallel
  Nessus installation
