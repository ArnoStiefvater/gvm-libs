openvas-libraries 1.0.3 (2009-03-06)

This is a maintenance release of the openvas-libraries module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 1.0 series.

It fixes issues discovered after the release of openvas-libraries 1.0.2 and
contains changes backported from the 2.0 series.

Main changes since 1.0.2:
* A incorrect library usage that prevented building RPM packages under
  certain circumstances has been fixed.
* A bug which led to segmentation faults on 64bit machines has been fixed.
* A bug which caused plugins to hang or freeze under certain circumstances due
  to a blocking pcap device has been fixed.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Tim Brown, Vlatko
Kosturjak, Jan Wagner, Jan-Oliver Wagner and Michael Wiegand


openvas-libraries 1.0.2 (2008-06-30)

This release contains improvements to plugin handling and to the packaging files
for various distributions as well as minor bug fixes and cleanups.
Apart from this, this release prepares OID support for OpenVAS.

It is recommended to update to this release, because future releases
of openvas-libnasl and openvas-libnasl will require openvas-libraries 1.0.2
as minimum version.

* Updates of the OpenSUSE, Fedora and Debian packaging files.
* Preparation for support for OpenVAS OIDs.
* Increased internal storage space for plugin preferences to allow for plugins
  with a large number of options.
* Fixed a bug that resulted in incorrect memory allocation on certain 64bit
  installations.
* Removed support for unencrypted communication with the client.
* Fixed a configuration issue that broke the build process on certain 64bit
  installations.
* Various code cleanups.

openvas-libraries 1.0.1 (2008-04-01)

Comprehensive code-reduction, include- and config-change release.

The changes might cause compile failures
or other defects for various operating systems.
Reports on problems are appreciated.

* Replaced inclusion of includes.h for many modules by respective
  separate include files.
* Configure checks for libresolv have been improved but still fail
  on some systems.
* File includes.h is not installed anymore.
* Compile option "--enable-bpf-sharing" and corresponding
  functionalityx has been removed.
* Added several include files which will be installed under include/openvas/
  These have been extracted from libopenvas.h which, for convenience,
  still includes all of the single new include files.
* Removed various unused modules and functions.
* Various fixes to reduce flawfinder warnings.
* Various fixes to reduce compiler warnings.
* Updates of the Debian packaging files.

openvas-libraries 1.0.0 (2007-10-12)

* More code cleanups.

openvas-libraries 0.9.1 (2007-09-13)

Further cleanups release.

Changes since 0.9.0 (2007-09-13):

* Renamed libhosts_gatherer to libopenvas_hg to
  resolved the last remaining filename conflict
  with nessus-libraries.
* Introduced its own versioning (independent of
  the other OpenVAS modules).
* Internal package improvements for less conflicts
  with nessus-libraries and less conflicts with LFSH.
* Switched on all compile-time warnings.
* Fixed some code warnings.

openvas-libraries 0.9.0 (2007-07-27)

The first initial release of openvas-libraries
after the fork from Nessus 2.2.x.

Main changes are:

* Replace OpenSSL by GNU/TLS (therefore it is allowed now to distribute
  binary packages with SSL-support)
* SSL now mandatory.
* Removed libpcap-nessus entirely. Now the system one is to be used.
* Many cleanups of ancient remains (still many to come)
* Removed various W32-specific elements, because W32 isn't
  a taget system anyway.
* Lots of renaming to avoid conflicts with parallel
  Nessus installation
