openvas-libraries 1.0.2 (2008-06-30)

This release contains improvements to plugin handling and to the packaging files
for various distributions as well as minor bug fixes and cleanups.
Apart from this, this release prepares OID support for OpenVAS.

It is recommended to update to this release, because future releases
of openvas-libnasl and openvas-libnasl will require openvas-libraries 1.0.2
as minimum version.
