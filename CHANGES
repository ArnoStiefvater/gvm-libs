openvas-libraries 1.0.1 (2008-04-01)

Comprehensive code-reduction, include- and config-change release.

The changes might cause compile failures
or other defects for various operating systems.
Reports on problems are appreciated.

* Replaced inclusion of includes.h for many modules by respective
  separate include files.
* Configure checks for libresolv have been improved but still fail
  on some systems.
* File includes.h is not installed anymore.
* Compile option "--enable-bpf-sharing" and corresponding
  functionalityx has been removed.
* Added several include files which will be installed under include/openvas/
  These have been extracted from libopenvas.h which, for convenience,
  still includes all of the single new include files.
* Removed various unused modules and functions.
* Various fixes to reduce flawfinder warnings.
* Various fixes to reduce compiler warnings.
* Updates of the Debian packaging files.

openvas-libraries 1.0.0 (2007-10-12)

* Now installs header files hosts_gatherer.h and hg_utils.h.
* More code cleanups.

openvas-libraries 0.9.1 (2007-09-13)

Further cleanups release.

Changes since 0.9.0 (2007-09-13):

* Renamed libhosts_gatherer to libopenvas_hg to
  resolved the last remaining filename conflict
  with nessus-libraries.
* Introduced its own versioning (independent of
  the other OpenVAS modules).
* Internal package improvements for less conflicts
  with nessus-libraries and less conflicts with LFSH.

* Fixed some code warnings.

openvas-libraries 0.9.0 (2007-07-27)

The first initial release of openvas-libraries
after the fork from Nessus 2.2.x.

Main changes are:

* Replace OpenSSL by GNU/TLS (therefore it is allowed now to distribute
  binary packages with SSL-support)
* SSL now mandatory.
* Removed libpcap-nessus entirely. Now the system one is to be used.
* Many cleanups of ancient remains (still many to come)
* Removed various W32-specific elements, because W32 isn't
  a taget system anyway.
* Lots of renaming to avoid conflicts with parallel
  Nessus installation
