* Configured values for the local state directory and for the system
  configuration directory are now honoured correctly during build time


openvas-libraries 3.0.0-beta2 (2009-09-28)

This release is the second beta version of openvas-libraries
leading up to the upcoming 3.0 release of OpenVAS.
It introduces a significantly improved and changed source
code architecture and therefore introduces a new API for the
other OpenVAS components.

OpenVAS 3.0 will introduce a new architecture where openvas-libraries
now includes openvas-libnasl as well as redundant code from openvas-client
and where openvas-server is renamed to openvas-scanner and includes any
platform-dependent elements of openvas-plugins. As a result of this,
the source code will shrink, though new features will be added. Also,
for running the scanner now only 2 modules are required (instead of 4
as for OpenVAS 2.0).

New features of OpenVAS include support for IPv6 and WMI-Clients.
Version 3.0 prepares the new OpenVAS Manager and OpenVAS Administrator
as optional extension. This combination leverages the vulnerability
scanner to a comprehensive vulnerability management solution.

The "beta" releases are intented to allow testing of the upcoming
3.0 series. It should be kept separate from OpenVAS 2.0 installations
and not be used in a production environment.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to the 3.0.0 release:
Chandrashekhar B, Marcus Brinkmann, Tim Brown, Vlatko Kosturjak, Michael Meyer,
Matthew Mundell, Laban Mwangi, Srinivasa NL, Jan Wagner, Jan-Oliver Wagner,
Michael Wiegand and Felix Wolfsteller.

Main changes compared to 2.0.x:

* IPv6 support
* WMI-Client support
* Integration of openvas-libnasl
* New library "base"
* New library "omp"
* Former libopenvas renamed to libopenvas_misc
* New NVT cache implementation to overcome limitations
* Several files from openvas-client integrated
* Use of "cmake" to build base, omp and nasl
* glib dependency raised from 2.6 to 2.12

Main changes compared to 3.0.0-beta1:

* Removed any packaging files as they are kept separately.
* Extended and cleaned up API (especially "include"'s)
* Consistent name scheme for libraries (libopenvas_XXX) where
  XXX is base, omp, misc, hg and nasl.
* New structure of installed header files (subdirectory for
  each library, except for misc)
* Fixed and improved build system (e.g. correct use of DESTDIR)

openvas-libraries 2.0.3 (2009-06-10)

This is the third maintenance release of the openvas-libraries module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0 series.

It fixes a small number of issues discovered after the release of
openvas-libraries 2.0.2 and introduces new functionality designed to enable
improvements in other OpenVAS modules.

Main changes since 2.0.2:

* Support for localized security messages (e.g. umlauts) has been re-enabled.
* New functions for GnuTLS-based communication were added.
* New functions for authentication were added.
* An improved caching framework has been added ("NVT Info objects").

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Matthew Mundell,
Jan Wagner, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Michael Wiegand and Felix Wolfsteller.


openvas-libraries 2.0.2 (2009-03-06)

This is the second maintenance release of the openvas-libraries module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0 series.

It fixes a number of issues discovered after the release of openvas-libraries
2.0.1.

Main changes since 2.0.1:
* A bug which caused plugins to hang or freeze under certain circumstances due
  to a blocking pcap device has been fixed.
* A bug which caused openvas-libraries to send a truncated HTTP version
  identifier when constructing HTTP requests has been fixed.
* A bug which broke the linking process under certain circumstances has been
  fixed.

Kosturjak, Michael Meyer, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Michael Wiegand and Felix Wolfsteller.


openvas-libraries 2.0.1 (2009-02-06)

This is the first maintenance release of the openvas-libraries module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0 series.

It fixes a number of issues discovered after the release of openvas-libraries
2.0.0 and introduces support for upcoming features. Thanks to the continuing
audit of the code, a number of obsolete, unused and/or unnecessary functions
were identified and removed. The amount and the quality of the source code
documentation has been improved as well.

Effect when installing this version: The cache of NVT descriptions (located in
plugin_folder/.desc/) will be rebuild at next start of openvasd.
The cache files used to have the suffix ".desc" instead of ".nasl", e.g.
"x.desc" corrsponds to "x.nasl".  Now, the suffix ".desc" is appended, e.g.
"x.nasl.desc" corresponds to "x.nasl".  This also prevents that e.g. "x.nasl"
and "x.nes" (or "x.oval") will overwrite each others' cache file.
Recommendation: Clean the entire cache directory before restarting openvasd. If
you don't do this, the .desc/ directory will contain all cache files twice.
Other than unnecessary disk space consumption this has no bad effect.


Main changes since 2.0.0:
* Renamed caching files to conflict-free scheme
* Prepared support for sub-directories in plugins_folder in accordance with
  Change Request #24 (http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-24.html)
* Support for improved management of SSH credentials has been added in
  accordance with Change Request #20 (http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-20.html)
* Established automated source code documentation. HTML-Version is available
  under http://www.openvas.org/src-doc/openvas-libraries/2.0.1/index.html

Bugfixes:
* A configuration issue which caused the build process to fail on Mac OS X has
  been fixed. (Solves: #761)
* Missing includes which caused the build process to fail on Darwin and NetBSD
  have been added. (Solves: #860, #862)

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Tim Brown,
Stjepan Gros, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Felix Wolfsteller and Michael Wiegand.

openvas-libraries 2.0-beta1 (2008-09-23)

This release is a first beta version of the upcoming 2.0 release of OpenVAS.
This is the first release of openvas-libraries to fully implement OID support
and marks the switch from the Nessus Transport Protocol (NTP) to the improved
and cleaned up OpenVAS Transport Protocol (OTP). In addition, this release
contains minor bug fixes and updates to distribution files.

OpenVAS 2.0 will introduce a full set of new modules for OpenVAS Server
(openvas-libraries, openvas-libnasl and openvas-server) and the a new
OpenVAS-Client. The only  module OpenVAS 1.0 and OpenVAS 2.0 will  share is
openvas-plugins. This means that the OpenVAS NVT Feed is compatible with both
generations of OpenVAS.

However, in case you plan to try out the new generation of OpenVAS, you should
install it separately from OpenVAS 1.0 installation. Instructions on how to do
this will be added to the OpenVAS homepage after all relevant modules are
released as 2.0-beta1. A separate announcement will officially start the beta
testing phase for OpenVAS 2.0.

Main changes in this release:
* Fix to incorrect library usage that prevented building RPM packages under
  certain circumstances.
* Updates of Debian packaging files.
* Switch from Nessus plugin IDs to OIDs.
* Switch from Nessus Transport Protocol 1.2 to OpenVAS Transport Protocol 1.0.

This release contains improvements to plugin handling and to the packaging files
for various distributions as well as minor bug fixes and cleanups.
Apart from this, this release prepares OID support for OpenVAS.

It is recommended to update to this release, because future releases
of openvas-libnasl and openvas-libnasl will require openvas-libraries 1.0.2
as minimum version.

* Updates of the OpenSUSE, Fedora and Debian packaging files.
* Preparation for support for OpenVAS OIDs.
* Increased internal storage space for plugin preferences to allow for plugins
  with a large number of options.

  separate include files.
* Configure checks for libresolv have been improved but still fail
  on some systems.
* File includes.h is not installed anymore.
* Compile option "--enable-bpf-sharing" and corresponding
  functionalityx has been removed.
