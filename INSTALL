INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPENVAS-LIBRARIES
===============================================

Please note: The reference system used by most of the developers is Debian
GNU/Linux 'Lenny' 5.0.  The build might fail on any other systems.  Also
it is necessary to install dependent development packages.

Compiling openvas-libraries
---------------------------

Prerequisites:
* libglib >= 2.12
* libgnutls >= 2.0
* libpcap
* libgpgme >= 1.1.2
* uuid-dev (from e2fsprogs)

Apart from these, some tools are required:
* a C compiler (e.g. gcc)
* bison
* flex
* cmake

Prerequisites for building documentation:
* Doxygen
* xmltoman (optional, for building man page)
* sqlfairy (optional, for producing database diagram)

Configure the build with

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/installation .

or (if you want to use the default installation path /usr/local)

    $ cmake .

This only needs to be done once.

Thereafter, the following commands are useful.

    $ make                # build the scanner
    $ make doc            # build the documentation
    $ make doc-full       # build more developer-oriented documentation
    $ make install        # install the build
    $ make rebuild_cache  # rebuild the make system cache


$ make install

Please note that you may have to execute this command as root, especially if you
have specified a prefix for which your user does not have full permissions.
