	* Should the versioning be separate from that of -libnasl
	and -server? Would mean to change NESSUS_MAJOR etc. in configure.in.
	Anywhere else?

	* libnessus-pcap: Why is it necessary to keep as copy?
	If needed, it might make sense to rename all of it to libopenvas-pcap
	to prevent confusion. Is there a new pcap that needs to be synced?
	Also note: actually, the license of pcap has advertisement clause.
