	* misc/plugutils.c and misc/store.c:
	These modules have functions that call functions
	of the other module and vice versa. This is a good
	hint on a broken design. The store (actually: cache)
	feature should eventually be designed in a better way.

	* MANIFEST: The method to create a dist could be imoroved to
	use svn export. This could make MANIFEST unneeded which in
	turn means less management efford.

	* configure.in: which autoconf minimum standard to define?
	Currently there are numerous warnings when running 2.13, e.g.
	configure.in:95: warning: AC_HAVE_LIBRARY is obsolete; instead use AC_CHECK_LIB

	* AIX: Is this a platform that is really important
	to be supported? Special treatment for AIX occurs
	at various places.
