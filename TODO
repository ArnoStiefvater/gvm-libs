	* misc/plugutils.c and misc/store.c:
	These modules have functions that call functions
	of the other module and vice versa. This is a good

	feature should eventually be designed in a better way.

	* AIX: Is this a platform that is really important
	to be supported? Special treatment for AIX occurs
	at various places.
