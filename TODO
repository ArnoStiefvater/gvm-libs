	* libopenvas/plugutils.c and libopenvas/store.c:
	These modules have functions that call functions
	of the other module and vice versa. This is a good
	hint on a broken design. The store (actually: cache)
	feature should eventually be designed in a better way.

	* Makefile: Fix dependencies to new header files.

	* include/includes.h: This file is not being used
	for libopenvas anymore nor installed. (It is still
	used for hg).
	However, this change might cause compile failures
	or other defects on systems other than Debian Etch.
	So, the remaining file might serve for reference
	to resolve such problems.

	* MANIFEST: The method to create a dist could be imoroved to
	use svn export. This could make MANIFEST unneeded which in
	turn means less management efford.

	* configure.in: which autoconf minimum standard to define?
	Currently there are numerous warnings when running 2.13, e.g.
	configure.in:95: warning: AC_HAVE_LIBRARY is obsolete; instead use AC_CHECK_LIB

	* AIX: Is this a platform that is really important
	to be supported? Special treatment for AIX occurs
	at various places.
