	* include/includes.h: This file is installed through Makefile.
	However, a similar file in in openvas-libnasl as well. It is
	not clear why this is to some extent redundant.

	* configure.in: which autoconf minimum standard to define?
	Currently there are numerous warnings when running 2.13, e.g.
	configure.in:95: warning: AC_HAVE_LIBRARY is obsolete; instead use AC_CHECK_LIB

	* libopenvas/getopt*: Is it really necessary
	to maintain copies? What are the differences
	to the original getopt modules?

	* AIX: Is this a platform that is really important
	to be supported? Special treatment for AIX occurs
	at various places.

	* Review Debian patches for nessus-libraries 2.2.8 and
	see what should be applied for openvas-libraries.

	* Should the versioning be separate from that of -libnasl
	and -server? Would mean to change NESSUS_MAJOR etc. in configure.in.
	Anywhere else?

	* libnessus-pcap: Why is it necessary to keep as copy?
	If needed, it might make sense to rename all of it to libopenvas-pcap
	to prevent confusion. Is there a new pcap that needs to be synced?
	Also note: actually, the license of pcap has advertisement clause.
