	* configure.in: which autoconf minimum standard to define?
	Currently there are numerous warnings when running 2.13, e.g.

	* libopenvas/getopt*: Is it really necessary
	to maintain copies? What are the differences

	* AIX: Is this a platform that is really important
	to be supported? Special treatment for AIX occurs
	at various places.
