	* include/includes.h: This file is not being used
	for libopenvas anymore nor installed. (It is still
	used for libopenvas_hg).
	However, this change might cause compile failures
	or other defects on systems other than Debian Etch.
	So, the remaining file might serve for reference
	to resolve such problems.

	turn means less management efford.

	* configure.in: which autoconf minimum standard to define?

	* AIX: Is this a platform that is really important
