	* Continue cleanup of header files as started for
	modules arglists and ftp_funcs:
	- Remove any "ExtFunc" declarations.
	- Move any declarations from include/libopenvas.h to
	  "libopenvas/modulename.h". If the latter exists already,
	  it should be renamed to "libopenvas/modulename-internal.h"
	  and the renaming be done in any of the files in "libopenvas/*"
	- Add the new header file to installed header in global "Makefile".
	- Add the new files to MANIFEST.
	- resolve generic includes in libopenvas/modulename.c (includes.h)
	  by specific includes of relevant files - if possible.

	* README.BPF: Still of relevance? BSD people to answer this.

	* MANIFEST: The method to create a dist could be imoroved to
	use svn export. This could make MANIFEST unneeded which in
	turn means less management efford.

	* include/includes.h: This file is installed through Makefile.
	However, a similar file in in openvas-libnasl as well. It is
	not clear why this is to some extent redundant.

	* configure.in: which autoconf minimum standard to define?
	Currently there are numerous warnings when running 2.13, e.g.
	configure.in:95: warning: AC_HAVE_LIBRARY is obsolete; instead use AC_CHECK_LIB

	* libopenvas/getopt*: Is it really necessary
	to maintain copies? What are the differences
	to the original getopt modules?

	* AIX: Is this a platform that is really important
	to be supported? Special treatment for AIX occurs
	at various places.
