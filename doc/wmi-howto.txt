COMPILING OPENVAS-LIBRARIES WITH WMI SUPPORT
============================================

Last updated: 2010-03-12

To compile openvas-libraries with WMI support, please follow the steps described
below. Our hope is that this code will ultimately make it into Samba itself;
until then, some additional work is necessary but should be straightforward if
you follow this guide.

1) Download the source tarball for wmi-0.1.13
This can be a bit difficult since the tarball is no longer provided by the
original authors; as of the time of this writing, the tarball is available from
the following location:

http://www.openvas.org/download/wmi/wmi_0.1.13.orig.tar.gz

The tarball should have the following MD5 checksum:
778e020ab780de36ac7ae2a0bdb60b19

Untar the source tarball with the following command:
$ tar xzvf wmi_0.1.13.orig.tar.gz

2) Apply the patch
To enable the WMI integration in OpenVAS, a patch needs to be applied to the
source you just downloaded. You can download the patch from the following
location:

http://www.openvas.org/download/wmi/openvas-wmi.patch

The patch should have the following MD5 checksum:
b57a51c791a8bbf8dd4abb59b44cc50d

Copy the patch to the wmi-0.1.13 directory you just created and apply the patch
with the following command:

$ patch -p1 < openvas-wmi.patch

3) Compile the source
In the wmi-0.1.13 directory, execute the following commands:
$ cd Samba/source
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make proto wmi/libwmiclient.so

If successful, this will result in the creation of the file
wmi-0.1.13/Samba/source/wmi/libwmiclient.so. Copy this file to your OpenVAS library
directory, which may be /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib or $prefix/lib, depending on
the configuration options you chose when building the other OpenVAS modules.

4) Compile openvas-libraries
Now configure openvas-libraries in the usual way. Remember to chose the same
prefix (if any) you used in the previous step. For example:

$ ./configure --prefix=/prefix/to/your/openvas/install

Watch the configure output closely. If you followed the steps above correctly,
you should see the following line close to the end of the output:

"checking for wmi_connect in -lwmiclient... yes"

If this line ends in "no" instead, make sure you have placed libwmiclient.so in
the correct directory and run the configure command again.

Now (re)build openvas-libraries and install them:

$ make
$ make install

After installing, you will be able to use NASL NVTs incorporating the new WMI
NASL functions.
