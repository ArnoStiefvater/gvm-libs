	* Consistently change OPENVAS_STATE_DIR to be plus "/lib/openvas".
	This is also to be done in the other modules. Maybe it is necessary
	to have the definiton at the lowest level (openvas-libraries) and
	the get the variable from there in the other modules instead of
	defining again.

	* array/hash comparison

	local_var a,b; a[0]=0; b[1]=1;
	if(a == b) { ... }

	* direct initialization of a variable

	local_var a=3;
	global_var g="nil";

	* use function which returns array/hash directly in expression

	function f()
	{
	  local_var a; a["drei"]=3; return a;
	}
	if(f()["drei"] == 3) { ... }
