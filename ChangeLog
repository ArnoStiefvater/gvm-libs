	(hg_dns_read_ns_from_answer, hg_dns_axfr_query): Replaced ns_get16

	changes as suggested by Bernhard Herzog. Deleting
	/lib/openvas/plugins/.desc/* is no longer neccessary.

2008-06-12  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@intevation.de>

	Increased the space available to plugins for preferences
	storage. This resolves an issue with plugins with a large
	number of radio button options, as they need to store the
	text for all options in the name field.

	IMPORTANT: You need to delete the server plugin cache in
	/lib/openvas/plugins/.desc/* to force the server to create
	a new cache after compiling with this change. Otherwise the
	server will send wrong plugin information to the client,
	resulting in missing options in the preferences.

	* libopenvas/store_internal.h: Increased size of name field
	in pprefs struct to allow for plugins with many preferences.

2008-05-06  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/arglists.h: Added forgotten ifdef.

	* MANIFEST: Updated.

2008-03-14  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	Removing unsused module "data". It was meant as a future
	replacement of arglists. However, it does only try the same
	philosophy with some improvments whereas it makes more
	sense to leave optimized handling to specialists like glib.

	* libopenvas/data.c, include/data.h: Removed.

	* TODO: Removed enty about data.c.

	* MANIFEST: updated.

2008-03-14  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	A sample cleanup for header files.

	* libopenvas/arglists.h: New. Contains external header information
	for module "arglists". (extracted from libopenvas.h)

	* Makefile: Install libopenvas/arglists.h.

	* include/libopenvas.h: Converted header block to standard one.
	Removed any arglists definitions and instead includes arglists.h.

	* libopenvas/arglists.c: Replace generic include of includes.h
	by respective required single include statements.
	Removed any use of "ExtFunc" declaration which is empty anyway.

2008-03-14  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/plugutils.c: Removed include for diff.h.

2008-03-14  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* include/libopenvas.h: Annotated module names, some lines reordered,
	removed W32 conditional.

2008-03-14  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* TODO: Added entry about data.c

2008-03-13  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/Makefile: Removed handling of module "diff".

	* libopenvas/diff.c, libopenvas/diff.h: Removed as the
	only method "banner_diff" isn't used anywhere in OpenVAS.

	* MANIFEST: updated.

2008-03-10  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	Removing the apparently unused module "snprintf". There exists
	no corresponding proto and thus it could never be used without
	occuring warnings during compilation. snprintf is part of C99.

	* libopenvas/Makefile: Remove handling of snprintf module.

	* MANIFEST: Updated.

	* libopenvas/snprintf.c: Removed.

2008-03-03  Laban Mwangi <labeneator@gmail.com>

	* libopenvas/plugutils.c, libopenvas/proctitle.c,
	libopenvas/store.c, libopenvas/www_funcs.c:
	Adding FlawFinder ignores to various string operations
	as discussed on the Mailing List.

2008-02-16  Laban Mwangi <labeneator@gmail.com>

	* libopenvas/hlst.c (flush_hlst, make_hlst, sort_hlst, unsort_hlst),
	libopenvas/hlst.h (_hlst): Fixing flawfinder l4 warnings
	related to flawfinder thinking that a ptr in a linkedlist called
	access is = the call access(2)

2008-02-15  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/store.c (safe_copy): Cast return value strlen to
	match format string.  Silences a compiler warning

2008-02-15  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/www_funcs.c (http11_get_head): Removed this unused
	function.  Silences a compiler warning.

2008-02-15  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas_hg/hg_dns_axfr.c (hg_dns_axfr_add_host)
	(hg_dns_read_ns_from_answer, hg_dns_axfr_query): Use ns_get16
	instead of _getshort.  _getshort is defined in glibc but not
	declared in any headerfile.  ns_get16 is a newer API but should be
	widely available, too.

2008-02-15  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/hlst.c (copy_hlst): Fix Flawfinder issue.

2008-02-15  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	fprintf args, adapting a format string to better match the purpose
	of printing the value of a pointer.

2008-02-15  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	Removal of Flawfinder issues.

	* libopenvas/system.c (emalloc): replace usleep() by nanosleep().
	(estrdup): Set two Flawfinder: ignore, one reported path can not
	happen (now documented) and whether to use strlen() is a more general
	question.

2008-02-15  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/system.c, libopenvas/system.h: Applied standard header,
	added comments on unclear things.

2008-02-15  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	http10_get_head, http11_head, http11_get): Removed. These functions have never been used.

2007-10-08  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas_hg/Makefile: Install hosts_gatherer.h and hg_utils.h

	* libopenvas/network.c (nessus_SSL_password_cb): Removed because
	it's not used anymore.

2007-06-22  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/network.c (nessus_SSL_init): Handle errors.

2007-06-22  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas-config.pre.in: remove the @pcap_flag@ substitution
	from the --libs output.  The pcap options are now in EXTRA anyway

2007-06-21  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/network.c (sslerror2, sslerror)
	(nessus_install_passwd_cb): Get rid of the last actual OpenSSL
	calls.  The implementations now simply print an error message and
	do nothing.

2007-06-20  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/network.c (open_SSL_connection): Better error
	handling for the gnutls function calls.

2007-06-20  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/network.c: Keep a pointer to the gnutls credentials
	struct so that it can be freed properly:

	member

2007-06-20  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	certificate and key.  Remove the warnign about unsupported key
	decryption.  Load the CA files if given.

2007-06-14  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	First step in the code to move from OpenSSL to GnuTLS.  The code
	in network.c now uses GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL for stream
	connections.  There are still a few remnants of the OpenSSL code,
	though and code using the library will still need to link -lssl.

	* libopenvas/network.c (struct nessus_connection)
	(release_connection_fd, nessus_register_connection, sslerror)
	(nessus_SSL_init, open_SSL_connection, open_stream_connection)
	(open_stream_connection_unknown_encaps5)
	(read_stream_connection_unbuffered, write_stream_connection4)
	(stream_pending): Use GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL.
	(stream_get_ssl): Now always returns NULL since there's no SSL*
	associated with a stream anymore.  See the comments in the code
	for some of the implications of this.
	(tlserror, set_gnutls_sslv23, set_gnutls_sslv3, set_gnutls_tlsv1):
	New functions for the GnuTLS support.

2007-06-04  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/network.c (struct nessus_connection)
	(open_SSL_connection, write_stream_connection4): Remove
	nessus_connection member last_ssl_err because it's only assigned
	to, but never used.

2007-05-25  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* VERSION: Renamed from CVS to SVN.

	* TODO: Some more open questions.

	commented out and never used.

2007-05-14  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* configure: updated.

2007-05-14  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* Makefile: Fixed name for libopenvas-config man page for installation.

	* VERSION: Set to .CVS.

	* MANIFEST: New. List of source files for dist.

	* Makefile: New target "dist".

2007-05-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* nessus-config.pre.in: Removed.

	* libopenvas-config.pre.in: New. Replaces nessus-config.pre.in.

2007-05-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* nessus-config.pre.in, Makefile: Removed DESTDIR. It looks
	pretty useless as it needs to be set in the shell.
	It was introduced in Nessus 1.3.1.

2007-05-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* libopenvas/plugutils.c: Removed any conditional alternatives
	for HAVE_SSL (ssl is mandatory now)

2007-05-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	First, intermediate step of migrating from OpenSSL to GNUTLS:
	Remove the all old stuff at the configure-level.
