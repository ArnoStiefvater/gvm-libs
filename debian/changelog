nessus-libraries (1.2.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * libnessus-dev's includes.h includes openssl headers, so it has to
    depend on libssl-dev, thanks to James Troup for noticing, closes: #159326.
    Perhaps the OpenSSL dependency should be removed from the header file
    instead, but the upstream likes it better this way.
  * Reworked the remaining libpcap-nessus exclusion patches.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Mon,  2 Sep 2002 21:57:16 +0200

nessus-libraries (1.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * This version no longer uses MAXHOSTNAMELEN in the place the old patch
    was fixing. It uses it in another location, but there it defines a
    default if the constant is not available. If this fixed default is
    still a problem for the Hurd (it shouldn't be, but what do I know),
    please send in another patch, closes: #106386.
  * ACKing NMU bug, closes: #156200.
  * Removed the pretty much pointless libc6-dev dependency from the -dev
    package.

nessus-libraries (1.0.10-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer upload
  * Rebuilt with new libpcap to remove dependency on libpcap0, which I
    got removed from unstable by accident. Sorry about this...

 -- Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Aug 2002 11:37:17 +0200

nessus-libraries (1.0.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to main. The only component of Nessus that needed non-US was
    an encryption layer library within the libnessus package.

nessus-libraries (1.0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Includes updated config.* files, which I've also had to copy to
    libpeks/, closes: #99851. There are two more outdated config.* file
    pairs but in subdirs that we don't build so it shouldn't crap out.
    Fingers crossed that the build system is still working.

nessus-libraries (1.0.7a-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Fri, 25 Aug 2000 23:10:44 +0200

nessus-libraries (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Package names changed, since lib{hosts_gatherer,nessus} has 1 in the
    SONAME. Additionally, I renamed libnessus1-dev to just libnessus-dev,
    since there's not going to be a need for several -dev packages, ever.
  * Added Conflicts: libnessus0-dev to libnessus-dev, and Conflicts:
    libnessus0 to libnessus1, because of duplicate headers and the same
    libpeks library.
  * Had to use manually written shlibs file, because dh_makeshlibs generated
    the entry for libpeks.so.0.8 wrong. :/
  * Used the new upstream scheme for specifying gmp and zlib in libpeks/*,
    plus a few new fixes of my own.

nessus-libraries (0.99.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Actually *link* libnessus0.so to system libpcap (doh!).
  * Made "-O2 -Wall -D_REENTRANT" the compiler flags, and fixed some
    stuff to make it propagate $CFLAGS to all subdirectories.
  * Fixed libpeks{,/doc} build system to use the system 'install' program
    instead of the slow shell script.
  * Wrote nessus-config.1 and integrated it into upstream sources.
  * Some changes in debian/*.

nessus-libraries (0.98.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Not only link libpeks* with dynamic libgmp2, but also don't *build*
    the included gmp2... thanks to gorgo again, for noticing. Closes: #49407.
  * After upstream confirmed it, removed all references to libpcap-nessus,
    and point to system libpcap instead.
  * Do 'cd libpeks/doc && make install' in debian/rules, to install a
    more complete set of libpeks documentation.
  * Standards-Version: 3.1.0.

nessus-libraries (0.98.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed libpeks' {configure,Makefile}.in not to include zlib and gmp
    libraries, but to link dynamically with those from libgmp2 and zlib1g
    packages, partly using Gorgo's patch. Closes: #49407.
  * Removed extra {pcap,zlib}.3 manual pages. Closes: #49466.
  * Minor adjustments in debian/*.

nessus-libraries (0.98.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

    correctly.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999 22:17:31 +0100

nessus-libraries (0.98.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    + libnasl (libnasl0 and libnasl0-dev)
    + nessus-core (nessus and nessusd)
    + nessus-plugins (ditto)

nessus (0.0.alpha2-fix4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (thanks, Javier!).
  * New upstream version (this number allows future 1.0 etc).
  * Separated the binaries in two packages: the client which depends
    on GTK+, and the server with plugins and the support libraries.
  * Doesn't build static libraries anymore. Removed the .so symlinks.
  * Added libtool rpath workaround and some other fixes in configure.in.
  * Using completely new debian/* files, fully extended with debhelper.
  * Package goes to non-US, because of the encryption libraries used.
  * Now Policy 3.x compliant, uses FHS et al.
  * Now uses /etc/nessus/ for config files, and /var/log/nessus/ for
    log files. Required changes in the upstream build system
    (configure.in, Makefile, etc).
  * TODO: investigate whether src/libpcap/tcp_* files make much difference
    between default libpcap.so and this custom libpcap-nessus.so.
