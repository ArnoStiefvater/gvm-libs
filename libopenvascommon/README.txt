This is an initial version of the upcoming
library "libopenvascommon".

The aim of this library is to provide all
basics for various OpenVAS modules to use.
Eventually this library should be packaged
separately in order to allow e.g. to
link OpenVAS-Client the library without
dependencies to e.g. network protocol
libraries.

NOTE: The structures and formats are currently
not settled and subject to change.
The API will, for the time being, be available
via libopenvas.
